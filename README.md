# Homework 2

## Overall process of submitting HW1
Please follow these steps to develop and submit the HW successfully:
1) **Follow the instructions precisely!** Ask if You don't understand them!
2) Check out this Git repository and commit Your changes often - **often and granular commits** with easy to understand improvements described in comments will both make it easy for me to understand Your though process and allow Yourself to easily overlook Your progress and revert specific changes in cases of errors.
3) I will only evaluate (and comment on/provide suggestions) on Your homework **once** (except if You request specific help beforehand)
4) By default I will evaluate the last commit pushed to this repository before the deadline announced. In case *You request it*, I will evaluate the latest commited code by applying the appropriate point reduction for late commits.
5) You can request help with understanding the homework and in some cases even with code itself - do this by commiting the code to Git and then sending me Your related question to e-mail. I reserve the right to help only with understanding/debugging, but will not provide any code for You.
6) In addition to commiting Your working code, You also **must fill HW2 Questionnaire in Ortus** - this will be ralated to Your completed code, so do it after the code is mostly done.
7) As stated before - academic integrity is key in any task in this course - violators will face serious consequences - DO NOT COPY or REWRITE CODE by other people. DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT OTHER students HW code before both of You have submitted Your final code. I will not try to distinguish who copied from whom - both parties will face equal punishment. Also don't borrow code from online pages and **don't use any C libraries, that I have not explicitly allowed**.

## Overall task in short
In this Homework You will build a family tree printing program.

## Step by step INSTRUCTIONS for HW2
Follow these steps and commit code after each step. The only allowed external libraries/functions are the ones already presented in lectures, like stdio.h or strings.h
